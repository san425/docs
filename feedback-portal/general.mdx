The feedback portal is a section of OmniSets where users can submit feedback, feature requests, and bug reports.
Similar to a forum, the feedback portal allows users to create posts, comment on existing ones, and upvote or downvote content.

## Code of Conduct
Users must treat all members with respect, stay on topic, avoid spam, and provide constructive feedback.
Respect privacy, avoid discrimination, and follow moderators' instructions.
Report inappropriate content and maintain only one account.
Non-compliance may result in disciplinary actions. Read the full code of conduct -> [here](feedback-portal/code-of-conduct).
