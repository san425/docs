<Note>
Interacting with the feedback portal on OmniSets _does_ require an account. If you don't have one yet, you can create one [here](https://www.omnisets.com/createnew/user/).
</Note>

## Basic Guidelines

- Tell us what mode you're talking about, "Study", "Quiz", "Match", etc. If you don't, we have no idea what you're talking about. (If applicable)
- Do not put multiple topics in one post. Keep it simple. Create multiple posts if you have to :)
- If it's a bug, tell us what you were doing when it happened. The more details, the better.

<Tip>
We get LOTS of feature requests from everywhere. It's hard to reply to each and every one, but please know that we **read them all** and do our best to implement them.
