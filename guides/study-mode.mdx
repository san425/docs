The first thing you want to do is enter the Study mode. You can do this by going to any studyset you want and clicking on the `Study` button on the right side of the page. Here's what that looks like (above).

<Note>
    You don't need to fork a studyset to study it, you can also jump into studying sets from the Library!

### Initial Settings and Options

_Let's walk through all of these options:_

- Answer With
    - You can choose to answer with the definitions or the terms. For example, if the term shows on the left, the question with definitions on the right, or vice versa.
- Card Selection
    - Either starred cards or all of them. If you choose starred cards, you will need to have at least 5 cards.

- Question Types
    - Written Response
    - Multiple Choice
    - True or False

- Review Type
    - Quick Review has much easier grading, and you can achieve mastery a lot faster. You won't see the same cards as much.
    - Complete Review has harder grading, making it difficult to master the cards. It will also show more cards many more times than Quick Review.

__Advanced Options:__

- Force Re-answer
    - It forces you to re-answer a question immediately after you get it wrong. You can't move on until you get it right.
- Adaptive Questions
    - This changes the question for each card based on your mastery of the card.
- Card Ordering Coming Soon
    - We recommend "Intelligent," which means AI will choose what card to show you next based on your performance. Sequential will follow the order of the cards in the set.
- Struggling Card Interruption
    - Stops the AI from showing the flashcard if you are struggling with the card.

### Clearing a session
To clear a session, enter the study mode and click `Start`. Then in the top right, select `Settings` and then press `Reset`.

### AI Features
#### Getting a hint
Above each question, there's an option to get a hint. Hints won't reveal the answer, but they will help guide you to the answer.

#### Explanation
After getting a question wrong, if you don't know why, you can press this to get an AI explanation of why your answer was wrong.

### Other features
- Take a Peek
    - See the entire card as you would in the normal view.
- Mark Correct
    - Mark correct if you think the AI graded it wrong.
