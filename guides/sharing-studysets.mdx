<Note>
    By default, all studysets are _private_. You do not need to worry about people seeing them.
</Note>

### Private Link
Click on `Edit Set` on the [StudySet Page](/guides/studyset-page/) and change the visibility to `Private Link`. Now, copy and share the URL of the studyset! It's that simple.

### Public StudySet (Library)
Follow the same steps as above, but this time, set the visibility to `Everyone`.
