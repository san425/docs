### Appearance
You can change OmniSets' appearance by choosing from different themes. Themes will be applied to all pages on OmniSets and saved to your account.

### Flashcard Text Size

You can change the size of the text on flashcards. This is useful if you have a lot of text on your flashcards and want to fit more on the screen. You can choose from Small, Normal, Large, and Largest.

Font Size will only be changed for all flashcards on valid flashcard pages. The following pages are valid flashcard pages:

- Flashcard Mode and StudySet Page
- Quiz Mode
- Match Mode
- Spell Mode
- Study Mode

### Use tab to switch between term and definition
If enabled, you can use the tab key to switch between the term and definition in the card editor.

### Reset Flashcard Facing
After viewing flashcards (on the StudySet page), the flashcards will reset to showing the front of the card again.

### Hide SubFolders
If you didn't know already, you can nest folders on OmniSets. This means you can have folders inside of folders. For example, if you have a folder called AP World History, you can have Unit 1, Unit 2, Unit 3, etc. inside of it. This is useful for organizing your sets. However, those unit folders will still show up as individual folders on your dashboard page. If you'd like to hide those folders, you can do so by enabling Hide Nested Folders.

### Adaptive Learning (beta)
Learn faster by analyzing how you study across OmniSets.

### Learning Speed (beta)
Manually dictate how fast you learn on a scale of 1-5-auto. Affects how often new cards are shown in the Study mode.
