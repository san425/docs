## What the page looks like
<Frame>
    <img width="500px" src="/images/studyset-page.png" alt="StudySet Page" />
</Frame>

On the left, you will see a big carousel of all the cards in the set. You can click on the arrows to go to the next card or the previous card. You can also click on the card itself to flip it over and see the other side. Tapping on the star icon will start the current card.

On the right, you will see a row of buttons. The first row represents all the modes this study set supports. The following row is different depending on who you are (owner, viewer). If you are the owner, you will have the option to edit the set. Otherwise, you will have the option to add it to your folders and fork (duplicate) the set.

<Info>
    You can only __Fork__ a studyset if the owner has enabled it.

<Warning>
    The view of the studyset page will change depending on whether the set is a public or private link and if you own it or not. But generally speaking, the layout will be the same.

### Modes
#### Study Mode
The Study Mode is an AI-powered tool that helps you study your flashcards. It will serve you with multiple choice, written responses and true or false questions. It will also keep track of your progress and has some other cool features that can make your studying experience easier. Enough talking; let's dive in!
#### Quiz Mode
Quiz Mode is a mode that allows you to test your knowledge on the studyset. You can choose between multiple choice, written responses, and true or false questions. You can also set the number of questions you want to answer. It's basically like a practice test!
#### Match Mode
Match Mode is a mode that allows you to match the term with the definition. It's a fun way to test your knowledge and see how well you know the studyset.
#### Flashcards Mode
A simple mode that allows you to flip and SORT the cards in the studyset by how well you know them. You can also star cards you want to review later.
#### Spell Mode
The Spell Mode is a written response only mode, where you have to spell out the term or definition. The difference is that it is heavily focused on spelling and accuracy and has lots of features and settings for you to customize your experience. Some of these are custom character ignore lists and hints.
