On May 27th, 2024, we introduced a major enhancement to StudyPlans, one of the most requested features from our community.
This enhancement allows you to add multiple StudySets to a single StudyPlan, providing greater flexibility and better organization for your study materials.

**Why the Migration?**

1. **Enhanced Functionality**: The new StudyPlans structure supports multiple StudySets, which was not possible with the old version. This improvement requires a structural change in how StudyPlans are stored and managed.
2. **Improved Performance**: The new setup optimizes performance, making your study experience smoother and faster. Migrating your existing StudyPlans ensures that you benefit from these performance enhancements.
3. **Custom Titles**: The updated StudyPlans now allow custom titles, enabling you to label your study plans according to your specific needs and preferences.

**How to Migrate**

The migration process is simple and user-friendly:

- **Step 1**: Click the "Migrate" button on your existing StudyPlan.
- **Step 2**: Follow the on-screen instructions.
- **Step 3**: Your StudyPlan will be upgraded to the new format seamlessly, and all your data will be preserved.
