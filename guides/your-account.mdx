#### Why we ask for your first and last name
We ask for your first and last name so that we can address you properly in emails and notifications. We also use your first and last name to personalize your experience on OmniSets. Additionally, maintaining complete user profiles, including first and last names, is helpful for avoiding duplicate accounts and preventing any confusion regarding user information.

By having your names on record, we can effectively communicate with you regarding your account and any issues that may arise.

<Note>
    Your first and last name are NOT required. You can leave them blank if you'd likeâ€”no problem!
