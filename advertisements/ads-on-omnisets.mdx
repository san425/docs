### Why We Show Ads on OmniSets

Our goal is to help everyone study faster and easier. To support our mission, we incorporate advertisements to sustain our operations. The revenue generated from ads helps us continue developing new tools, maintaining our platform's infrastructure, and offering our services at no cost.

> For nearly 2 years, OmniSets has ran without ads, and without paywalls. We've helped over 75k users study efficiently and effectively. Unfortunately as OmniSets grows, so do our costs and we need to find a way to cover them. We've decided to run ads on the site to help cover some of these costs.
>

> Choosing to place ads was not an easy decision, and we're not just saying that. We've spent countless hours trying to find a way to keep OmniSets ad-free, but we've come to the conclusion that it's not possible. Ads are the only way for us to recoup our costs while making our platform be accessible to everyone.
