## Creating your first StudySet

The first thing you'll want to do is create a StudySet. 
A StudySet is a collection of flashcards that you can study. 
You can create a StudySet by clicking on the `+` button on the top right of the page, then selecting `New StudySet`

<Info>
We'll only cover StudySets in this guide for now, but you can also create StudyPlans and Folders.
</Info>

If you click the New StudySet button, you should see a modal that looks like this:

<img width="500" src="/images/new_StudySet_modal.png" />


For now, hit `Create from scratch`. You should now be seeing a page that looks like this:

<img width="500" src="https://help.omnisets.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FMN1VH93.png&width=300&dpr=2&quality=100&sign=5f4c182ef260ac52fc3cfedde71e3de03df8834f6f5473c15a8396a6cea315fb" />



Add whatever tags you'd like, such as AP, Biology, Chemistry, etc. You can also add a description if you'd like.

<Tip>
Forking allows you or others (if the StudySet is public) to create a copy of the StudySet. This is useful if you want to make a copy of a StudySet and make changes to it without affecting the original StudySet.
</Tip>

Once you're done, hit `Create StudySet` and you should be redirected to the card editor.

## Adding Cards
On this page, you can add flashcards to your StudySet. You can add a card by clicking on the Add button on the bottom right of the page.
