## Creating your first StudySet

The first thing you'll want to do is create a StudySet. A StudySet is a collection of flashcards that you can study. You can create a StudySet by clicking on the `Create StudySet` button on the top right of the page.

We'll only cover StudySets in this guide for now, but you can also create StudyPlans and Folders.

If you click the `New StudySet` button, you should see a modal that looks like this:

For now, hit `Create from scratch`. You should now be seeing a page that looks like this:

Add whatever tags you'd like, such as `AP`, `Biology`, `Chemistry`, etc. You can also add a description if you'd like.

<Info>Forking allows you or others (if the studyset is public) to create a copy of the studyset. This is useful if you want to make a copy of a studyset and make changes to it without affecting the original studyset.</Info>

Once you're done, hit `Create Set` and you should be redirected to the card editor.

## Adding Cards

On this page, you can add flashcards to your studyset. You can add a card by clicking on the `Add` button on the bottom right of the page.

## Studying

Now that you've created a studyset, you can study it by clicking on the `Study` button on the top right of the page.
